    //we can also use bracket notation for adding the new property and value just like dot notation jthe difference is that we can't use property like del-lang for dot notation
    // console.log(product2['name']);
    // console.log(product2['delivery-day']);//it will give an error because javascript will understand this like a math

    //we can say that console is builten object and log is a function both together make method 

    //They are provided by the language
    //2 more builten objects JSON (javascript object notation) LocalStorage
    //JSON is basically a syntax , a similar syntax to javascript
    //it has less syntax
    //JSON doesnot support single quote and function AND it can understand by every programming language
    //to send data to multiple computers we use JSON
    //convert javascript object to JSON

    //  METHOD
    //conversion of product2 that was in object in javascript to json
    // console.log(JSON.stringify(product2));
    //conversion of JSON to javascript
    // const jsonString = JSON.stringify(product2);
    // console.log(JSON.parse(jsonString));

    //local storage save values more permanently
    //local storage only supports string

    //null v undefined (in most cases null and unddefined work the same way)
    //null ---> intentionally want something to be empty


    //auto-boxing
    //it also works with number and boolean except undefined or null
    //it wrape a string in an object first then we apply properties or method
    //strings can also have properties  
    console.log('hello'.length);
    console.log('hello' .toUpperCase()); //this a method

    //we can't compare objects directly 
    //reference compare the the object variable not the code inside
    //actully we compare the reference instead of values inside it which is save in computer memory
    //shortcut for objects destructing--> const {message,price} = object4;

    //second is shortend property
